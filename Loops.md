# 🧠 Java Assignment  
## 🔁 **Assignment Title: "Sum of Even Numbers in an Array"**

---

## 🎯 **Objective:**

Write a Java program that takes an array of integers and calculates the **sum of even numbers** present in the array.

---

## 📥 **Input:**
- An array of integers (you can either take a static array or take input from the user).
  
Example input:
```
Array: [12, 7, 9, 18, 4, 21]
```

---

## 🧠 **Task:**
1. Create an array of integers.
2. Loop through the array and check for even numbers.
3. If a number is even (i.e., divisible by 2), add it to the sum.
4. Print the sum of all even numbers in the array.

---

## 🎯 **Expected Output:**
For example, given the input array `[12, 7, 9, 18, 4, 21]`, the sum of even numbers will be:
```
Sum of even numbers: 12 + 18 + 4 = 34
```

## 📤 **Submission Guidelines:**
- Ensure to handle arrays of different sizes.
- Make the solution flexible for any array input.
- Add comments explaining your code logic.

---

## 🧠 **Concepts Covered:**
- Arrays
- Loops
- Conditional checks inside loops
- Summation logic
