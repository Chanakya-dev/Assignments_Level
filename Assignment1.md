## ðŸ“š Java Assignment: **Student Grade Calculator**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Objective:**
Create a Java program to collect basic student information, take marks in 3 subjects, calculate total, average, and determine pass/fail using appropriate data types, operators, and input using `Scanner`.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Requirements:**

1. **Take input** from the user using `Scanner`:
   - Student Name (`String`)
   - Roll Number (`int`)
   - Age (`int`)
   - Marks in 3 Subjects (`float` or `double`)

2. **Calculate and Display:**
   - Total Marks
   - Average Marks
   - Whether the student has passed in all subjects (pass mark is 35 in each)
   - Grade according to average:
     ```
     >= 90: A+
     >= 75: A
     >= 60: B
     >= 50: C
     < 50 : D
     ```

3. **Use Operators:**
   - Arithmetic Operators for calculations
   - Relational & Logical Operators to determine pass/fail and grade

### ðŸ”„ **Sample Input/Output:**

```
Enter student name: John Doe
Enter roll number: 101
Enter age: 18
Enter marks for Subject 1: 85
Enter marks for Subject 2: 78
Enter marks for Subject 3: 92

--- Result ---
Name: John Doe
Roll No: 101
Age: 18
Total Marks: 255.0
Average Marks: 85.0
Status: Pass
Grade: A
```

---

### ðŸ“¦ **Concepts Covered:**
- `Scanner` class for input
- Primitive data types: `int`, `double`, `String`
- Variables and their scope
- Arithmetic (`+`, `/`), Relational (`>`, `<`, `>=`), and Logical (`&&`) operators
- Conditional logic with `if-else`
