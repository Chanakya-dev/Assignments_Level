### âœ… **Java Functions Assignment: Print Student Data**

### Problem Statement:

Create a Java class named `StudentData`. In this class, implement the following methods:

1. **`public void printStudentName(String name)`**:
   - This method will accept the student's name as a parameter and print:
   ```
   Student Name: <name>
   ```

2. **`public int calculateAge(int birthYear, int currentYear)`**:
   - This method will accept the student's birth year and the current year as parameters and return the student's age.

3. **`public static void displayStudentDetails(String name, int age, String course)`**:
   - This **static** method will accept the student's name, age, and course as parameters, and print:
   ```
   Student Details: 
   Name: <name>
   Age: <age>
   Course: <course>
   ```

4. **`public void printStudentGrade(String grade)`**:
   - This method will accept the student's grade as a parameter and print:
   ```
   Student Grade: <grade>
   ```

5. **`public String getStudentCountry(String country)`**:
   - This method will accept the student's country as a parameter and return a message:
   ```
   The student is from <country>
   ```

### **Sample Outputs:**

1. `printStudentName("Alice")` should output:
   ```
   Student Name: Alice
   ```

2. `calculateAge(2000, 2025)` should return:
   ```
   25
   ```

3. `displayStudentDetails("Alice", 25, "Computer Science")` should output:
   ```
   Student Details:
   Name: Alice
   Age: 25
   Course: Computer Science
   ```

4. `printStudentGrade("A")` should output:
   ```
   Student Grade: A
   ```

5. `getStudentCountry("USA")` should return:
   ```
   The student is from USA
   ```

### **Requirements:**
- Demonstrate the usage of **`void`**, **`return`**, **`static`**, **`parameters`**, and **non-static methods**.
- Call the methods from the `main()` method in the class to print the student data.
